As they search for a rental, users might also want to narrow their search
 to a specific city. Let's build a component that will let them search for
  properties within a city, and also suggest cities to them as they type.

To begin, let's generate our new component. We'll call this component 
`filter-listing`.

```shell
ember g component filter-listing
```
As before, this creates a Handlebars template 
(`app/templates/components/filter-listing.hbs`) and a JavaScript file 
(`app/components/filter-listing.js`).

The Handlebars template looks like this:

```app/templates/components/filter-listing.hbs
City: {{input value=filter key-up=(action 'autoComplete' filter)}} 
<button {{action 'search'}}>Search</button>

<ul>
{{#each filteredList as |item|}}
  <li {{action 'choose' item.city}}>{{item.city}}</li>
{{/each}}
</ul>
```
It contains an [`{{input}}`](../../templates/input-helpers) helper, that 
renders as a text field that the user can type in to look for properties 
in a given city. The `value` property of the `input` will be bound to the 
`filter` property in our component. The `key-up` property 
will be bound to a `autoComplete` action in our backing object, and passes
 the `filter` property as a parameter.

It also contains a button, whose `action` parameter is bound to the 
`search` action in our component.

Lastly, it contains an unordered list, that uses the `filteredList` 
property for data, and displays the `city` property of each item in the 
list. Clicking the list item will fire the `choose` action, which will 
populate the `input` field with the name of the `city` in the clicked list
 item.

Here is what the component's JavaScript looks like:

```app/components/filter-listing.js
export default Ember.Component.extend({
  filter: null,
  filteredList: null,
  actions: {
    autoComplete() {
      this.get('autoComplete')(this.get('filter'));
    },
    search() {
      this.get('search')(this.get('filter'));
    },
    choose(city) {
      this.set('filter', city);
    }
  }
});

```
There's a property for each of the `filter` and `filteredList`, and 
actions as described above. What's interesting is that only the `choose` 
action is defined by the component. The actual logic of each of the 
`autoComplete` and `search` actions are pulled from the component's 
properties, which  means that those actions need to be [passed]
 (../../components/triggering-changes-with-actions/#toc_passing-the-action-to-the-component) 
 in by the calling object, a pattern known as _closure actions_.

To see how this works, change your `index.hbs` template to look like this:

```app/templates/index.hbs
<h1>Welcome to Super Rentals</h1>

We hope you find exactly what you're looking for in a place to stay.
<br /><br />
{{filter-listing filteredList=filteredList 
autoComplete=(action 'autoComplete') search=(action 'search')}}
{{#each model as |rentalUnit|}}
  {{rental-listing rental=rentalUnit}}
{{/each}}

{{#link-to 'about'}}About{{/link-to}}
{{#link-to 'contact'}}Click here to contact us.{{/link-to}}
```
We've added the `filter-listing` component to our `index.hbs` template. We 
then pass in the functions and properties we want the `filter-listing` 
component to use, so that the `index` page can define some of how it wants 
the component to behave, and so the component can use those specific 
functions and properties.

For this to work, we need to introduce a `controller` into our app. 
Generate a controller for the `index` page by running the following:

```shell
ember g controller index
```

Now, define your new controller like so:

```app/controllers/index.js
export default Ember.Controller.extend({
  filteredList: null,
  actions: {
    autoComplete(param) {
      if(param !== "") {
        this.store.query('rental', {city: param}).then((result) => {
          this.set('filteredList',result);
        });
      } else {
        this.set('filteredList').clear();
      }
    },
    search(param) {
      if(param !== "") {
        this.store.query('rental', {city: param}).then((result) => {
          this.set('model',result);
        });
      } else {
        this.set('model').clear();
      }
    }
  }
});
```

As you can see, we define a property in the controller called 
`filteredList`, that is referenced from within the `autoComplete` action.
 When the user types in the text field in our component, this is the 
 action that is called. This action filters the `rental` data to look for 
 records in data that match what the user has typed thus far. When this 
 action is executed, the result of the query is placed in the 
 `filteredList` property, which is used to populate the autocomplete list 
 in the component.

We also define a `search` action here that is passed in to the component,
 and called when the search button is clicked. This is slightly different
  in that the result of the query is actually used to update the `model` 
  of the `index` route, and that changes the full rental listing on the 
  page.

For these actions to work, we need to modify the Mirage `config.js` file 
to look like this, so that it can respond to our queries.

```app/mirage/config.js
export default function() {
  this.get('/rentals', function(db, request) {
    let rentals = [{
        type: 'rentals',
        id: 1,
        attributes: {
          title: 'Grand Old Mansion',
          owner: 'Veruca Salt',
          city: 'San Francisco',
          type: 'Estate',
          bedrooms: 15,
          image: 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cb/Crane_estate_(5).jpg'
        }
      }, {
        type: 'rentals',
        id: 2,
        attributes: {
          title: 'Urban Living',
          owner: 'Mike Teavee',
          city: 'Seattle',
          type: 'Condo',
          bedrooms: 1,
          image: 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0e/Alfonso_13_Highrise_Tegucigalpa.jpg'
        }
      }, {
        type: 'rentals',
        id: 3,
        attributes: {
          title: 'Downtown Charm',
          owner: 'Violet Beauregarde',
          city: 'Portland',
          type: 'Apartment',
          bedrooms: 3,
          image: 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f7/Wheeldon_Apartment_Building_-_Portland_Oregon.jpg'
        }
      }];

    if(request.queryParams.city !== undefined) {
      let filteredRentals = rentals.filter(function(i) {
        return i.attributes.city.toLowerCase().indexOf(request.queryParams.city.toLowerCase()) !== -1;
      });
      return { data: filteredRentals };
    } else {
      return { data: rentals };
    }
  });
}
```

With these changes, users can search for properties in a given city, with
 a search field that provides suggestions as they type.
